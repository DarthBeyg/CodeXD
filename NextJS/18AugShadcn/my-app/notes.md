shadcn is a reuseable, customizeable components "collection"/library
almost all components run "dev" but at build and deployment sucks
in this lecture sir told us about "husky"
which is a git hook, doesn't let deployment of a project i.e commit on github
without checking for errors or checking build.
but for that you must ensure that the project is not in a repo
but a separate repo. i didn't do because i didn't need it now
